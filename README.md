Many thanks to the New York City Campaign Finance Board see www.nyccfb.info/searchabledb/

Also many thanks to http://nypd.openscrape.com for setting a good example of how we can improve access to data, especially public data.

Think about this, if we pass transparency laws and those laws give us access to thousands or even millions of pieces of information and those pieces cannot be easily processed (for example, posted as scanned PDF files, etc) then the reality is the information is not really useful for maintaining transparency.  The data liberation movement means API level access to the data ideally OR data that can be imported into a database of some type.
